The basic commands exercise was this:

show the name of your home directory
create a directory
create an empty file
print working directory
change into a directory
change into the current directory (pointless in real life, only as an exercise)
change into a directory one level above
create a hierarchy of directories (e.g. /tmp/all/my/folders) in one command
list a directory in a short format
list a directory in a long format
remove a directory
remove a non-empty directory
copy a file
move a file
show first 5 lines of a file ("head")
show last 5 lines of a file ("tail")
stream the entire file on the screen
given a text file, print only the lines containing the letter 'a'
list the current directory, showing only the files that have a particular extension (e.g. txt) using wildcards
count the number of lines in a text file
count the number of words in a file
use redirection to list files, then select only the ones with a specific extension, then count their number
find all files in your home directory that start with letter "b"
show the manual entry page for a given command
show the list of environment variables
create a new environment variable
check that a given environment variable exists
create a new env variable, open and new terminal value and check whether it exists
modify your ~/.bash_profile file to permanently set an env variable and check that it works in a new terminal
show the permissions for a file
remove the execute permission for the user and for the group
add the write permission for the "other"
create a directory and remove the permission that allows you to change into it
use the 'echo' command to print "hello, world!" on the screen
create a file hello.rb and add the line "puts 'hello, world!'" into it using command line only. Run it by passing its name as an argument to ruby.
create a file hello.rb and make sure you can execute it by running it directly (hint: you'll need a ruby shebang + specific permissions.
list all processes on the system ("ps" command with some extra flags), find out how many processes of Google Chrome are running using grep and wc.
